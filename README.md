## Overview
Marketing Agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines.

The .html and .css files have been modified for a better client and user experience. The .css file had a lot of repetitive code so I consolidated the code to include only what is necessary. Also, I cleaned up the .html code with the elements following a logical structure independent of styling and positioning making it easier to read. Additional modifications in the .html file include, adding div id="search-engine-optimization" to Search Engine Optimization within the nav bar so that it links/brings you directly to the Search Engine Optimization section within the main content area, adding accessible alt attributes to image elements and defining the title element with a concise, descriptive title. I also modified both the .html and .css files by adding comments where I thought could be helpful.
