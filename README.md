## Overview



At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 
Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.
If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage 
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```

## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features
If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.

## License
The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)
